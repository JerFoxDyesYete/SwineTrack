SwineTrack - Right on Time, Healthy Swine
-
SwineTrack is an IoT-based swine health and pig pen monitoring system designed to help hog raisers detect early health risks in pigs. The system continuously monitors swine body temperature, ammonia levels, and humidity, and displays the data through a mobile application.

📌 Features:

- Non-contact swine body temperature monitoring
- Ammonia level detection for air quality monitoring
- Humidity monitoring inside pig pens
- Android mobile application for real-time monitoring
- Alert indicators for abnormal conditions
- Cloud-based data storage using Supabase


🛠️ Hardware Requirements:

- ESP32 microcontroller
- ESP32-CAM module
- MLX90640 thermal array sensor
- BME680 (ammonia, humidity, environment sensor)
- Stable power supply
- Wi-Fi connection


💻 Software & Technologies Used:

- Arduino IDE
- React Native (Mobile App)
- Supabase (Backend & Database)
- Android OS (Android 8.0 and above)
- Git for version control


📱 Mobile Application

The SwineTrack mobile app allows the user (hog raiser) to:

- View real-time sensor data
- Monitor pig pen conditions
- Receive alerts for abnormal readings
- Access historical monitoring data


🎯 Purpose of the Project

SwineTrack aims to support early health risk detection and biosecurity awareness in small-scale and backyard swine farms by reducing reliance on manual observation and improving monitoring accuracy.


🚫 Limitations

- The system does not diagnose diseases
- Requires stable power and internet connection
- Android-only application
- Designed specifically for swine monitoring
